Hello! My name is Sándor Kovács and I'm a second year PhD student at the University of Debrecen.
I'm currently working on 86Kr(a,n) cross section measurements at my home institution and analyzing data from our previous RIKEN RIBF measurement. 

If you're interested in my professional work, check out my [ORCID](https://orcid.org/0009-0009-9796-2970).
