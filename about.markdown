Hello!

I'm Sándor Kovács, a second-year PhD student at the University of Debrecen, and a researcher at HUN-REN Atomki. My current work focuses on 86Kr(a,n) cross section measurements, which are crucial for understanding the weak r-process. In addition to my ongoing experiments, I am also analyzing data from our previous RIKEN RIBF measurements.
