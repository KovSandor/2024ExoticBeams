As you may have noticed from my poster, the Particle Identification Diagram (PID) and the final fitted histograms provide our results on half-life and delayed neutron emission probabilities. Below, I will briefly outline the key steps involved in obtaining these results.

At RIKEN RIBF, we utilized a cocktail beam containing various isotopes. This approach allowed us to measure the nuclear decay properties of multiple neutron-rich isotopes simultaneously, but it also introduced challenges in data analysis.

Accurate isotope identification is critical. As an initial step, you can project a section of the PID along a specific atomic number (e.g., Z=61 for Pm) to differentiate isotopes based on their A/Q values. However, this method can also introduce contamination from other isotopes.

When examining the 3D version of the PID, it becomes evident that isolating the relevant isotopes is a complex process.

Graphical cuts and additional conditions from auxiliary detectors are employed to isolate the relevant isotopes.
With the isotopes identified, we can then analyze specific implantation events and extract the time distribution of coincidence events (beta, gamma, neutron) to create the corresponding coincidence histograms. 
These histograms are subsequently fitted to determine the decay properties, including half-life and delayed neutron emission probabilities.
