## Welcome
You can download the pdf version of my poster through the [following link](/KovacsSandor-ExoticBeamsPoster.pdf) for your convenience.


You have already seen the Particle Identification Diagram (PID) on my poster and the final fitted histograms which give our final half-life and delayed neutron emission probabilities.
In the following I would like to briefly introduce the steps to make this happen.

At RIKEN RIBF we used a cocktail beam which contained many different isotopes. 
This made it possible to measure the nuclear decay properties of many neutron-rich isotopes at once but it makes the analysis more difficult.

It is crucial to correctly identify the isotopes in question.
