As you may have noticed from my poster, the Particle Identification Diagram (PID) and the final fitted histograms provide our results on half-life and delayed neutron emission probabilities. Below, I will briefly outline the key steps involved in obtaining these results.

At RIKEN RIBF, we utilized a cocktail beam containing various isotopes. This approach allowed us to measure the nuclear decay properties of multiple neutron-rich isotopes simultaneously, but it also introduced challenges in data analysis.

Accurate isotope identification is critical. As an initial step, you can project a section of the PID along a specific atomic number (e.g., Z=61 for Pm) to differentiate isotopes based on their A/Q values. However, this method can also introduce contamination from other isotopes.

When examining the 3D version of the PID, it becomes evident that isolating the relevant isotopes is a complex process.
